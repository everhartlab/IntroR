I am a computational biologist currently working a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of [Dr. Sydney E. Everhart][see] at the [Department of Plant Pathology at University of Nebraska-Lincoln][unl]. My research focus seeks to understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution of clonal plant pathogens. 

I grew up in Cupertino, CA, but got my undergraduate degree in Biology at [Truman State University][tsu] in Kirksville, MO where I had a research opportunity to work on understanding the [regulation of shoot apical meristem development in maize][1]. After graduation, I spent three years teaching and making music in South Korea before going back to the US to pursue my graduate education.

My Ph. D. is from the [Department of Botany and Plant Pathology][bpp] at [Oregon State University][osu] where I worked in the lab of [Dr. Nik Gr√ºnwald][nik]. [My dissertation][diss] focuses on my development of computational tools for analyzing clonal populations in the R package [*poppr*][poppr].
