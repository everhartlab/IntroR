Workshop Outcomes
-----------------

In this workshop, we expect to present enough information to get you started on 
your way to learning R. Because this is a three hour workshop, our goal is to 
demonstrate a simple analysis in R, emphasizing problem solving and 
troubleshooting. By the end of the workshop you should have just enough
background to be able to learn more.

Required Materials
------------------

Again, because this is a three hour workshop, we ask that you come prepared with
a laptop that has the most recent versions of [R] and [RStudio] installed, and
our [workshop materials] downloaded to your Desktop. **We cannot provide service
for installation the day of the workshop. Those who are not prepared for the 
workshop may be asked to give up their seat to those on the waitlist**.

### Installation

Even if you already have [R] installed on your system, you really should make
sure its up to date. This ensures that there are no problems due to outdated
software. For more details about installing [R], [RStudio], and keeping
everything up to date, UBC's [STAT545] page is an excellent resource.

 - [R]
 - [RStudio]
 - [Workshop Materials] (zip file; unzip to Desktop)
 - (Once you've installed R) packages "[tidyverse]" and "[agricolae]"

### Verification

Once you have installed [R], we should verify that you have the correct version.

 1. Open R (or RStudio) on your computer
 2. Enter the following in the R console after the `>`    
        
        R.version.string == "R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21)"
        
 3. Make sure the result is **`[1] TRUE`**    
    (If the result is `[1] FALSE`, please quit R and try the installation again)
 
 
### Workshop Materials

Our [workshop materials] is a zip file that contains a folder called 
`IntroR-master/` with the folowing structure:

```
.
├── IntroR.Rproj
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── Part1-Introduction.R
├── Part2-Analysis.R
├── Part3-Visualization.R
├── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── FungicideExample.csv
│   └── README.md
└── docs/
    └── ...
```

We are providing the R scripts for the workshop. We will be live-coding these
scripts, and **we encourage you to follow along by creating your own R scripts**
so that you can get comfortable typing these commands. For those who feel the
pace is too fast, or are unable to type the commands, feel free to execute the
code in these scripts to follow along.

### Installing Packages

To install [tidyverse] and [agricolae] to your system, open R and type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "agricolae"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```
