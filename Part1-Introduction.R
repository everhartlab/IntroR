# 
# Let's get familiar with R 
# =========================
# 
# In this section we will investigate the following questions:
#  [[  How does R understand data?  ]]
#
#  1. How to use this R script
#  2. Creating objects
#  3. Sequences and vectors
#  4. Matrices and evaluating a matrix
#  
# Part 1: How to use this R scrpt
# -------------------------------
# 
# A script is a text document that contains instructions and commands
# The # symbol is used to leave comments, which R will not try to interpret as a command
#
# The console (below) is for submitting commands to be interpreted in R. To run a 
# command in the console, you can copy+paste it into the console and press enter.  
# 
# Run a single line of your script in the console by placing your cursor on the line
# you want to submit and use your cursor to press the "Run" button at the top right.
# You can also use the shortcut key strokes cmd+enter (mac) or ctrl+enter (PC) to run 
# a single line at a time.
#
# Part 2: Creating objects
# -------------------------
#
# It is easier to understand objects if we are working with a real data set. We have
# obtained data from an experiment that was designed to assess the best method for 
# control of stripe rust disease. Typically, different wheat cultivars have different
# susceptibility to disease. Fungicides can also help reduce disease. 
# 
# This experiment rated stripe rust disease severity for three cultivars, with and without
# fungicide, over the course of a growing season.  The following are data that were
# obtained from the experiment. 
#

# 
# Part 3: Sequences and vectors
# -----------------------------
# 
# Part 4: Matricies and evaluating a matrix
