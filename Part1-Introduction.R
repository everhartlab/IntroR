# 
# Let's get familiar with R 
# =========================
# 
# In this section we will investigate the following questions:
#  [[  How does R understand data?  ]]
#
#  1. How to use this R script
#  2. Creating objects
#  3. Sequences and vectors
#  4. Matrices and evaluating a matrix
#  
# Part 1: How to use this R scrpt
# -------------------------------
# 
# A script is a text document that contains instructions and commands
# The # symbol is used to leave comments, which R will not try to interpret as a command
#
# The console (below) is for submitting commands to be interpreted in R. To run a 
# command in the console, you can copy+paste it into the console and press enter.  
#
# Copy and paste the following into the console and run it: 

    print("the teacher's name is Sydney")  
 
#
# Run a single line of your script in the console by placing your cursor on the line
# you want to submit and use your cursor to press the "Run" button at the top right.
# You can also use the shortcut key strokes cmd+enter (mac) or ctrl+enter (PC) to run 
# a single line at a time.
#
# You can also select only part of a line to have it run on the console.  Try running
# the following command without copy+paste:   print("my name is _____") 
#
#
# Part 2: Creating objects
# -------------------------
#
# It is easier to understand objects if we are working with a real data set. We have
# obtained data from an experiment that was designed to assess the best method for 
# control of stripe rust disease. Fungicides can be used help reduce disease. 
# 
# Anne was the scientist performing this experiment had field plots in a single location.
# She rated stripe rust disease severity on the wheat cultivar 'Cutter' that was either 
# treated with fungicide or *not* treated with fungicide. Her ratings for disease
# were made nine times during the growing season.  Here are her disease severity data
# from the experiment. 
# 
#  'Cutter' without fungicide: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 3.62, 17.89
#  'Cutter' with fungicide: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.79, 2.4, 6.21
#
# Anne is summarizing her data and wants to know how much fungicide application was able
# to reduce the disease severity.  She wants to know this for each day and also for the 
# cumulative disease severity rating.
